            <h3>Month Two Update </h3>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>During my last internship in this country, I would be boarding my plane home right about now. However, this time around I am two months in and still just getting started. <br><br>

            Since my last update, I have completed the training that I was facilitating. The training was for those acting as teachers in a village school program, but have never had the opportunity to receive an education themselves. These teachers are trying to help the next generation get that which they could not. In a place where education is not a priority and often out of reach, it was so encouraging to meet with this group of adults who wanted something different for their children. They know that if transformation is going to take place in their community, people need options and opportunities for better lives. Even though they may be considered under qualified in some aspects, they are extremely committed to developing the children in their care. It was an honor to spend several weeks equipping them with tools to accomplish what they are passionately working towards.<br><br>
             
            After working with this group of teachers, I have come to realize just how common this story is. There are village children all over this country that will never receive a quality education. And there are often adults in these communities, especially the children's mothers, who want to help. They simply just don't know how to do so. A goal of mine over the next couple of months is to focus on teaching these adults basic skills, and train them to then teach these lessons to other people in their communities, including children. When multiplication like this happens, transformation closely follows.<br><br>
             
            Although this country is officially Muslim, there are heavy ties to animistic rituals. I was confronted with this the day of the eclipse. Many people here think that when things like that occur in nature, there is a supernatural explanation. As a result, they are compelled to appease whatever spirit they associate with that particular event. The family that I live with specifically took that day to go to the cemetery and try to communicate with their ancestors. In their sincere desire to be good hosts, they invited me to go along. I politely declined, and my lack of desire to accompany them that day raised suspicion, and marked the beginning of a series of conversations between us. Eventually the question came: Are you Muslim? I answered honestly and told them that I am Christian. There was some surprise, but no hatred. Since then, they have been just as kind to me as they were before, and there have been no negative repercussions. I knew that that conversation was inevitable, and honestly I couldn't have asked for it to go any better. Praise God. Now that they know, my prayer is that I would live in a way that gains favor in their eyes, and points them to the God that I have claimed to be following. They probably have never met another Christian, and I pray that as I continue to interact with them they would see Christ through me, and associate those who follow Him with righteousness and love.</p>

            <i> I sincerely appreciate your prayers and ask that you will: <br>
                -Pray for the communities that I will be starting to work in. Pray that God would go before me and prepare people's hearts. Pray that the community leaders will grant me access into these places.<br>
                -Pray for my heart as I continue to serve here. Some of these places are absolutely heartbreaking and it is easy to get discouraged. Pray that I would have the kind of strength that only comes from God.<br>
                -Pray that my relationship with God would increase. Being somewhere that doesn't have many like-minded believers makes it more challenging to stay on track. Pray that I would be disciplined in finding ways to get fed independently.</i>

            <h3>Month One Update</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="content">
            <p>Seven flights and fifteen time zones later, I finally arrived. 
            However, it was not accomplished without a bit of trouble and frustration. 
            I have been trying to get a visa for several months, but was met with obstacles every step of the way. Eventually, I had no choice but to board the plane without one. While I couldn't get into “my country”, I was able to enter a neighboring Asian country and apply for my visa at the consulate there.
            God always provides in His timing, and within 24 hours I was holding my visa. 
            From there, I was able to board another plane and enter this country with no issues.
            Unfortunately, once I got here, I didn't have anywhere to go. The house that I was planning to rent suddenly became unavailable while I was flying here. It was extremely stressful not knowing where I was going to be sleeping that night, especially considering the previous stressors. But again, God always provides. Word got around the community that a foreigner was looking for somewhere to stay, and a local family graciously offered me a room in their home: Not just any room, but the room of honor, which is what we may equate with a master bedroom. The generosity shown to a complete stranger, one that does not even speak their language, astonished me. These barriers did not stop them from stepping in and reaching out when they heard that someone was in need. I truly respect that, and am convicted through their example. This family is Muslim, and they are a better example of love and generosity than many Christians that I know, including myself. I have much to learn from people like them.

            Once I was settled into my new room, everything began to fall into place.
            I have begun classes at the local university, and have started learning the language. I may have a long way to go, but in the meantime I am really enjoying the study of this beautiful language and culture. 
            I was plugged into a house-church, and despite none of them speaking English, I feel there is potential for great fellowship. 
            Additionally, I started my community development work. I have been doing some wholistic training for the teachers of a school program in a nearby village. This is what I love to do, and am excited to see God transform communities, and myself, here.  
             
            Life here is definitely different, but it is still a life. Bucket showers can still make you feel clean; White rice will still fill you up; Lanterns can give you enough light in the evening. I have everything that I need, just not in the ways that I'm used to. Yet, you can’t help but think of how much "better" things are in America, with all of the comforts that you've always known. But, the more I think about it the more I realize that things aren't better there, or worse here. They are just different. Millions of people live their whole lives like this, and never complain about it. So why should I? Life here is different, but a good life nonetheless.</p>
          </div>
            <i> Please pray for me as I continue my life here.<br>
                -The family that I live with is so great, as I shared above. Regardless, living in such close quarters with Muslims does add some risk to the security of my work here. Pray for Gods protection and discernment as I interact with them.<br>
                -While I was given a visa, it is only valid for two months. After that, I will have to apply for a renewal. Please start praying that that process will go smoothly and that I will get approved.<br>
                -Im still very new here and trying to find my way. Pray that I would start to build meaningful relationships with locals, and get connected to communities that I could invest time into. </i>
